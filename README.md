## PartD

1. Conditionals (if-else)
2. Complex conditionals (nested if-else)
3. Loops
4. Nested loops
5. User-defined methods
6. User-defined methods with parameters
7. User-defined methods with return values
8. Use of additional libraries other than: PrintWriter and FileWriter, Math, String, Arrays, PrintWriter, PrintStream, File, or Scanner.
9. 2D Arrays (or arrays of greater dimension)
10. Object inheritance
11. File Input
12. Advanced Input validation: Check if users input their names
13. Use of flags, sentinels, or semaphores, other than to simply determine if a loop should repeat or not.
    1. Example: A flag which indicates if a file is currently in use.
    2. Example: A special value which marks the end of a set of data. 
14. Use of try-catch to handle **at least two** checked exceptions so that your main method does not require a "throws" warning. Include a useful reaction.
